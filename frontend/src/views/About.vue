      <p>This app presents a list of days off based on "rolling days off" from a given start date and a constant day off.</p>
      <p>For example, if your most recent day off was Friday, your next day off would be the following Saturday. Because Sunday is your constant day off, your next day off won't be the following Sunday, but the next nearest Monday.</p>
